# âœ… Contact Route Updated Successfully!

I've updated the contact route with your working nodemailer configuration.

## ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT: You MUST Restart the Backend Server

The contact route has been updated with the hardcoded Gmail credentials:
- **Email:** saedsmail2025@gmail.com
- **Password:** kpyjjytladjgqjxb

### How to Restart:

#### Step 1: Stop the Current Backend Server

Find the terminal running the backend and press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

**OR** run this in PowerShell:
```powershell
taskkill /F /PID 1064
```

#### Step 2: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000
```

#### Step 3: Test the Contact Form

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/contact`
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Send Message"

### Expected Console Output (Backend)

When the form is submitted, you should see:
```
Attempting to send email...
From: saedsmail2025@gmail.com
To Admin: saedsmail2025@gmail.com
âœ… Admin email sent successfully. Message ID: <some-id>
Sending confirmation to user: user@example.com
âœ… User confirmation email sent successfully. Message ID: <some-id>
```

### What Will Happen

1. **Admin Email** - You'll receive the contact form message at `saedsmail2025@gmail.com`
2. **User Email** - The person who submitted the form will receive a confirmation email

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The contact form will work ONLY after you restart the backend!

Restart now and test! ðŸš€
