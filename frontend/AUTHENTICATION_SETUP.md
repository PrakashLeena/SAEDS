# Firebase Authentication Setup

## Overview
Firebase Authentication has been successfully integrated into the SAEDS Community Hub website.

## What Was Added

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/config.js`)
- Initialized Firebase app with your project credentials
- Added Firebase Authentication module
- Exported `auth` instance for use throughout the app

### 2. Authentication Pages
- **SignIn Page** (`src/pages/SignIn.js`)
  - Email/Password sign-in
  - Google Sign-in
  - Error handling
  - Redirects to profile after successful login

- **SignUp Page** (`src/pages/SignUp.js`)
  - Email/Password registration
  - Google Sign-up
  - Password confirmation validation
  - User display name setup
  - Error handling

### 3. Authentication Context (`src/context/AuthContext.js`)
- Manages authentication state globally
- Provides `currentUser` object
- Provides `logout` function
- Handles authentication state changes

### 4. Updated Components

#### Profile Page (`src/pages/Profile.js`)
- Now uses Firebase authentication
- Displays actual user data (name, email, join date, avatar)
- Redirects to sign-in if not authenticated
- Added logout button

#### Navbar (`src/components/Navbar.js`)
- Shows Sign In/Sign Up buttons when user is not authenticated
- Shows Profile icon when user is authenticated
- Updated for both desktop and mobile views

#### App.js
- Wrapped with `AuthProvider` for global auth state
- Added routes for `/signin` and `/signup`

## How to Use

### For Users
1. **Sign Up**: Click "Sign Up" in the navbar
   - Fill in name, email, and password
   - Or use "Sign up with Google"

2. **Sign In**: Click "Sign In" in the navbar
   - Enter email and password
   - Or use "Sign in with Google"

3. **Profile**: After signing in, click the profile icon to view your profile

4. **Logout**: Click the "Logout" button on your profile page

### For Developers

#### Check if user is authenticated:
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { currentUser } = useAuth();
  
  if (currentUser) {
    // User is signed in
    console.log(currentUser.email);
  }
};
```

#### Logout user:
```javascript
const { logout } = useAuth();
await logout();
```

#### Access user data:
```javascript
const { currentUser } = useAuth();

// Available properties:
currentUser.email
currentUser.displayName
currentUser.photoURL
currentUser.uid
currentUser.metadata.creationTime
```

## Firebase Console Setup Required

Make sure the following are enabled in your Firebase Console:

1. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Email/Password authentication
   - Google authentication

2. **Authorized Domains**:
   - Add `localhost` for development
   - Add your production domain when deploying

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The Firebase API keys in `config.js` are currently exposed in the code. This is normal for Firebase client-side apps, but make sure to:

1. Set up Firebase Security Rules
2. Enable App Check for production
3. Restrict API key usage in Google Cloud Console
4. Never commit sensitive backend service account keys

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Profile editing
- Social auth providers (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- Protected routes component
- Remember me functionality
