# Firebase Configuration Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded Credentials Removed**
- Changed `config.js` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- This improves security and allows proper environment-based configuration

### 2. **Missing Environment Variable Added**
- Added `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` to `.env.example`

## Action Required

You need to update your `.env.local` file with the correct Firebase credentials:

1. **Open** `frontend/.env.local` (or create it if it doesn't exist)

2. **Add/Update** these Firebase environment variables:

```env
# Backend API URL
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Firebase Configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAAq5pyl5oTxYZpiYKesH0HTeyph66sSCk
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=saeds-c04b1.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=saeds-c04b1
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=saeds-c04b1.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=190411788882
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:190411788882:web:541f6f42d4552a1456858b
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ZHLVKFDBHF
```

3. **Important**: Make sure the `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` is set to `saeds-c04b1.appspot.com` (NOT `saeds-c04b1.firebasestorage.app`)

4. **Restart** your React development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Why This Happened

- Firebase credentials were hardcoded in `config.js`
- The storage bucket URL had a mismatch between `.env.example` and `config.js`
- Environment variables weren't being used, so changes to `.env.local` had no effect

## Verification

After restarting the server, Firebase should work properly. You can verify by:
1. Opening the browser console (F12)
2. Checking for Firebase initialization errors
3. Testing the sign-in/sign-up functionality

## Security Note

Never commit `.env.local` to Git. It's already in `.gitignore`, but make sure to keep your Firebase credentials secure.
